# 🎯 Flutter Practice: Lottery App

This repository is part of my journey to master **Flutter development** by learning fundamental concepts and applying them in a fun, interactive project — a **Lottery App**.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### ✅ Flutter & Dart Concepts
- 📦 **StatelessWidget in Detail**  
  Understanding the immutable widget tree and UI structure.

- 🔁 **StatefulWidget in Detail**  
  Learning how to manage state, use `setState()`, and build dynamic interfaces.

- 🧮 **Variables and Data Types in Dart**  
  Practice with `int`, `String`, `bool`, and Dart-specific syntax.

## 🎰 Mini Project: Lottery App

A simple yet interactive mini project where:
- A random number is generated.
- The user presses a button to "draw" their number.
- If the number matches the winning number (e.g., 5), a congratulatory message appears.
- If not, a “Better Luck Next Time” message is displayed — beautifully styled.

This project reinforces how to combine **logic + UI** in Flutter using concepts like state management, conditionals, layout widgets, and styling.
